# STEMDebugging
A repository with debugging exercises for a workshop given during the EOA National Girls In STEM conference.

The exercises were all taken from exercism.io and solved to pass the tests exercism provided. 
Once the tests were passed, bugs were introduced - many of them were ones I had to resolve in solving the tests.

The test files are located in the `/spec` directory and the source code is located in the `/src` directory. 
Included in each source directory and in the root directory 
are SpecRunner.html files. These files allow the user to view the test results in the browser.

## Exercism.io
For the original exercises or additional problems to solve, check out http://exercism.io/languages/javascript. 
This repository includes the following exercises
* Bob (a response bot)
* Leap (calculating leap years)
* Pangram (checking sentences for pangrams)
* Space Age (calculates ages based on other planets' orbital length)
* Roman Numerals (converting a number to a roman numeral string)
* Triangle (determining what kind of triangle three sides make)
